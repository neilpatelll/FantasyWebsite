# Full Stack Fantasy Sports Website 

## Planning and Requirements Gathering:
Define the scope and features of your fantasy sports website.
Identify the target audience and user requirements.
Create user stories or use cases to capture the desired functionality.
Plan the database schema and define the necessary entities and relationships.
Determine the technologies and frameworks to be used for the backend and frontend.

## Backend Development (Spring Boot):
Set up a new Spring Boot project using a build tool like Maven.
Configure the project dependencies and necessary libraries.
Create the database schema using SQL or a database migration tool like Flyway.
Define the entities/models in Spring Boot that map to the database tables.
Implement repositories or data access objects (DAOs) using Spring Data JPA to interact with the database.
Create service classes to encapsulate the business logic and interact with the repositories.
Develop RESTful API endpoints using Spring MVC annotations for CRUD operations on the entities.
Implement authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
Configure the database connection properties and any other necessary application properties.
Write unit tests for the backend components to ensure their correctness.

## Frontend Development (React.js):
Set up a new React project using Create React App.
Create reusable UI components for various parts of the application (e.g., header, footer, navigation).
Design and implement the user registration and login components.
Create components for managing teams, selecting players, and viewing leaderboards.
Implement forms for user input and handle form submissions.
Integrate with the backend API endpoints using Axios or Fetch to retrieve and update data.
Implement client-side routing using React Router for navigation between different pages/views.
Apply styling to the components using CSS or a styling library like styled components or CSS modules.
Handle user authentication and authorization on the frontend to protect certain routes or components.
Write unit tests for the frontend components using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

## Integration and Testing:
Ensure proper communication between the frontend and backend by testing the API endpoints.
Handle errors and edge cases gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to the user.
Perform end-to-end testing to verify the functionality of the entire application.
Conduct performance testing to ensure the application can handle the expected load.
Perform security testing to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities.
Iterate and refine the application based on testing results and user feedback.

## Deployment and Hosting:
Hosting on AWS.
Configure the necessary environment variables and database connection settings for the production environment.
Build and package the Spring Boot application into a deployable artifact 
Deploy the backend application to the chosen hosting platform.
Select a static hosting service for the frontend application which is AWS S3
Build the React application and deploy the optimized production build to the static hosting service.
Configure any necessary DNS settings and domain mapping.
