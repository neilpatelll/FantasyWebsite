1. Planning and Requirements Gathering
Define Scope and Features:

User registration and login
Team management
Player selection
Leaderboards and statistics
User profiles
User Stories:

As a user, I want to register and log in so that I can access my account.
As a user, I want to create and manage my fantasy team.
As a user, I want to view player statistics and leaderboards.
Database Schema:

Error Handling:

Handle errors and edge cases gracefully
End-to-End Testing:

Perform end-to-end testing to verify the entire application's functionality
Performance Testing:

Conduct performance testing to ensure the application can handle the expected load
Security Testing:

Perform security testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities
5. Deployment and Hosting
Backend Deployment:

Package the Spring Boot application into a JAR/WAR file
Deploy to AWS EC2 instance
Frontend Deployment:

Build the React application
Deploy to AWS S3 for static hosting
Configuration:

Set environment variables and database connection settings for production
Configure DNS and domain mapping
